=== When to Use Advanced Features

.Recursive Extraction:: When working with MSI, PKG, RPM, or other formats containing nested archives
.Error Handling:: For production applications requiring robust error recovery
.Performance Tuning:: For large archives or batch processing scenarios

=== Quick Reference

.Recursive extraction
[source,ruby]
----
Excavate::Archive.new('installer.msi').extract(recursive_packages: true)
----

.Error handling
[source,ruby]
----
begin
  archive.extract(target)
rescue Excavate::Error => e
  handle_error(e)
end
----

=== Next Steps

Start with <<recursive-extraction,Recursive Extraction>> for handling nested
archives, then explore error handling and performance optimization.
