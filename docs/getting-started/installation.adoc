== Installation

=== Purpose

This guide covers installing Excavate on your system. Excavate is a 100% pure
Ruby gem with no native dependencies, making installation straightforward on any
platform that supports Ruby.

=== References

* https://rubygems.org/gems/excavate[Excavate on RubyGems]
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Installing Ruby]

=== Concepts

Excavate is distributed as a Ruby gem through RubyGems.org. It requires Ruby 2.7
or later and has no compiled dependencies, ensuring compatibility across all
platforms including Linux, macOS, Windows, and BSD.

=== Pure Ruby Benefits

Excavate is a 100% pure Ruby gem with no native extensions:

* **No compilation required**: Works immediately after installation
* **Cross-platform**: Same gem works on Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD
* **Multiple Ruby implementations**: MRI, JRuby, TruffleRuby
* **No system dependencies**: No need for libarchive, 7-zip, or other tools
* **Easy deployment**: No build tools needed in production

=== Requirements

==== Ruby Version

Excavate requires Ruby 2.7 or later. Check your Ruby version:

[source,bash]
----
ruby --version
----

If you need to install or update Ruby, see the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[official Ruby installation guide].

==== Operating System Support

Excavate works on all platforms that support Ruby:

* Linux (all distributions)
* macOS (10.14+)
* Windows (10+)
* BSD systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD)
* Any other Ruby-compatible platform

==== Dependencies

Excavate depends on these pure Ruby gems:

=== Installation Methods

==== Method 1: Installing from RubyGems (Recommended)

Install the latest stable version:

[source,bash]
----
gem install excavate
----

This installs both the library and the `excavate` command-line tool.

==== Method 2: Using Bundler in Your Project

Add to your `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'excavate'
----

Then install:

[source,bash]
----
bundle install
----

==== Method 3: Installing from Source

For development or to use unreleased features:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/omnizip/excavate.git
cd excavate
bundle install
bundle exec rake install
----

=== Verifying Installation

After installation, verify Excavate is available:

[source,bash]
----
excavate --version
----

You should see output like:

[source,text]
----
excavate version 1.0.0
----

Test basic functionality:

[source,bash]
----
excavate --help
----

This displays the available commands.

=== Quick Test

Create a test archive and extract it:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'excavate'

# Create a simple test
File.write('test.txt', 'Hello, Excavate!')
system('zip test.zip test.txt')

# Extract using Excavate
archive = Excavate::Archive.new('test.zip')
archive.extract('output')

puts "Extracted to: #{archive.extract('output')}"
----

=== Troubleshooting

==== Command Not Found

If `excavate` is not found after installation:

1. Ensure the gem binaries directory is in your PATH:
+
[source,bash]
----
gem environment
----
+
Look for the "EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY" path.

2. Add it to your PATH if needed (typically `~/.gem/ruby/X.X.X/bin`):
+
[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$PATH:$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')/bin"
----

==== Permission Errors

If you get permission errors during installation:

1. Use the `--user-install` flag:
+
[source,bash]
----
gem install excavate --user-install
----

2. Or use a Ruby version manager like rbenv, rvm, or asdf instead of the system Ruby.

==== Version Conflicts

If you encounter dependency conflicts:

[source,bash]
----
gem update --system
gem install excavate
----

=== Next steps

Now that Excavate is installed:

* Continue to <<quick-start,Quick Start Guide>> to extract your first archive
* Learn <<basic-usage,basic usage patterns>>
* Explore <<../guides/index,comprehensive guides>> for different formats
