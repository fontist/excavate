==== PKG

macOS installer package format. An XAR archive containing CPIO payloads.

==== Pure Ruby

Implemented entirely in Ruby without native extensions or compiled code.

==== Recursive Extraction

Automatically extracting archives within archives.

==== RPM

Red Hat Package Manager format. A Linux package format containing compressed
CPIO payloads.

==== TAR

Tape Archive format. A Unix archive format that preserves file metadata.

==== XAR

eXtensible ARchive format. Used by macOS for `.pkg` installer packages.
