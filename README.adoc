= Excavate: Ruby gem to extract nested archives

Extract nested archives with a single command.


== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "excavate"
----

And then execute:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install excavate
----


== Usage

To extract an archive containing other archives inside:

[source,ruby]
----
target = Dir.mktmpdir
Excavate::Archive.new("path/to/archive.cab").extract(target, recursive_packages: true)
----

The same but allowing to choose only necessary files inside:

[source,ruby]
----
target = Dir.mktmpdir
Excavate::Archive.new("path/to/archive.cab").files(recursive_packages: true) do |path|
  FileUtils.mv(path, target) if path.end_with?(".txt")
end
----


== CLI

`excavate` can be used via command line. To extract an archive including the nested ones:

[source,sh]
----
$ excavate --recursive path/to/archive.cab
----

If you'd like to skip extraction of nested archives, just use:

[source,sh]
----
$ excavate path/to/archive.cab
----

To extract a particular file or files specify them as last arguments:

[source,sh]
----
$ excavate --recursive archive.cab file1 dir/file2
----

Also `excavate` supports extraction from nested archives:

[source,sh]
----
$ excavate --recursive archive.cab dir/nested.zip/file
----
